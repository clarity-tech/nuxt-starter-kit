_Nuxt Starter Kit_ is an opinionated boilerplate based off of [Nuxt3](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/)(beta), with all the essentials you would want ready, up and running when starting a Nuxt project to play and experiment with.

Out of the box you get all the `essentials`

- **Typescript** as the Nuxt Module setup
- **Tailwind Module** via Nuxt Tailwind Module for zero configuration start and view config via `http://localhost:3000/_tailwind/`
- **editorconfig** for Consistent styling
- **ESLint** for static code analysis (added but it's currently failing due to [#171](https://github.com/nuxt/eslint-config/issues/171)) and
- **Prettier** for code formatting

and more...

**Note**:

ðŸš§ Nuxt 3 is currently in beta and is not yet production ready.

But we will make sure the broilerplate updated with latest updates and conventions when required

## Quick Start

## Known Issues just for code linting in development

- [ESLint](https://github.com/nuxt/eslint-config/issues/171) - Once the issue is resolved you can add
```json
        "*.+(js|ts|vue)": [
            "yarn run lint"
        ],
````

in `package.json` under the `lint-staged` section for linting on commits
